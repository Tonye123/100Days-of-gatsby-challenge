This has been fun so far. I really enjoyed going through the tutorial and setting this up. I have been wanting for the longest time to learn gatsby and graphQL.
 I  decided toward the end of 2019 that by the end of the first quarter of 2020, I would know these two technologies.I was intrigued when I saw the tweet for the 100 days gatsby challenge, it was just perfect.

I hope to complete all challenges,and maintain my new shiny blog :). Never been one for blogging, but will hopefully keep at it!

Challenge 1 done!
