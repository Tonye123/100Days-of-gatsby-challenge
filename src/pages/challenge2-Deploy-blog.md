So for the second challenge, we were asked to deploy our sites, I believe from challenge 1. This part I had already done, so for this challenge I learnt about sourcing data from wordpress. I decided to work with wordpress cause of my background with wordpress.

This had a lot of similarities with markdown, except i didnt have a create a slug(thank heavens!) and a few other differences.

Looking forward to this weeks challenge!
