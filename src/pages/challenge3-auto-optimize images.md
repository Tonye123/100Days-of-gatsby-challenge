This challenge was to optimize images with gatsby plugins for optimization. As usual I enjoyed working on this
cause it gave me a better control of the images I added to my site, without slowing the site down.

Also created an about page with my selfie :), was not too clear on the black and whit boxes though, in the challenge description. Will figure that out later.

On to the next challenge!
