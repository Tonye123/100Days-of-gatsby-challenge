For this challenge, I created a contact me mdx page, and imported the form component created 
in the previous challenge.

This was a good challenge, will try to create make mdx blog post going forward. Hopefully that wouldn't
be too tough setting up.

Challenge 6 is already out! Yikes... will get right on that! 

Cheers!
