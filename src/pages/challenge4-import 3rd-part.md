For this challenge, we were tasked to add a 3rd part react component, called Formlik and add a form to our about page.

I especially do not enjoy creating forms, for some reason. Going through the formlik tutorial, on how to go about this, was beautiful! Formlik really does all the heavy lifting for you. I also incorporated another tool called Yup for form validation. This was recommended by formlik. Its an amazing tool to use.

So after setting up the form and I went ahead to create a free account with Formik to recieve the submitted form. This was too easy to set up. Really happy with the progress made.


See you in the next challenge.
ps I really need to paginate my blog! maybe thats the next challenge:)
