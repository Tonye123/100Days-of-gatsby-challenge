This challenge was a continuation from the previous form challenge. And I already
set up my form data collection with Formik, which was extremely smooth. Will try a different 
service later just to compare.

As for the serverless AWS set up. I asked myself one question, Tonye why? it did my head in 
trying 
to set it up. So I decided I prefer using a service, thank you very much. lol 

Till next week....
